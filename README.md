They/Them

Currently working on a simple top-down game and visual novel for two game jams

I'm currently learning...
- how to improve my game mechanics with better physics and math calculations.
- how to create better transitions and reset states.
- how to construct a game's story.

My socials | Instagram, Bluesky or X (Twitter), and TikTok uses fuzzwil

Fun Fact | I made my current persona, Jaiden Vulpes since 2024. They are a descendant of spirits who hunt souls for a living. They live in a den but when on an adventure or on a quest, they'll stay at different Inns.
